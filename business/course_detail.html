			<h3>Review of Professor</h3>
		
			<div>
			<p>
				I'm sure she's a nice lady and all, but if 8A is your first CS class, I'd strongly warn against taking it with her. You'll gain a hollowed out understanding of Java which will be the result of a professor who doesn't understand the language very well and is unable to communicate abstract concepts in a reasonable way. Find another professor.

				She's not the best lecturer. I had to go to the TAs for help. She goes through slides too quickly and sometimes she mumbles things and just keeps going. She has the best intentions but just not a good way of demonstrating them. Exams were difficult, but if you read the book you should be OK.

				I am ashamed that my university employs people like this. This professor was so horrible, I couldn't keep up although I wanted to so bad. After CSE 8A, I was looking forward to 8B. But this professor's exams made me feel very bad about myself. Almost half the grade was to be determined in last 2 weeks. Had to drop because of bad grad in midterm.

				Just not a good professor. Making everything over-complicated. And most importantly, exams don't even make sense (focused on concepts while it's not even code any more, there's no purpose so it's hard to understand at first, and she doesn't drop lowest score or curve or anything). Choose another professor if you don't have to take her.

				I respect her for focusing on preparing the students for real world jobs and application of the material but she's awful at explaining everything that's going on. The discussion was entirely more helpful than lecture. The book is necessary to make sense of the handouts and everything.

				Arguably the worst professor ever. She does not know how to explain things and spent the majority of the time explaining how everything that went wrong wasn't her fault because "she didn't write the presented information". Maybe she should actually do her job as the PROFESSOR and look over the information she presents BEFORE she presents it.

				Marx's teaching style is horrible--IF you can call that teaching. She covered all things graphics in 20 minutes during our 80 minute lecture. It's not even teaching! When asked questions, she might answer, but after a while, she'll spend a good 5 minutes asking you to see her after class or during office hours because you're holding up the class.

				Her quizzes are difficult and only vaguely related to the material she teaches. If asked a question in class, she often gets very confused and flustered; she will give an ambiguous answer or not answer at all. There are errors and contradictions in her own code and programming assignments. She is very unorganized. No curve
